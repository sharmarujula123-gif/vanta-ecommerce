⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the backend project root.

Typical configuration includes the values required by the application's database, authentication, Cloudinary, Razorpay, and CORS configuration.

Do not commit .env or production credentials to Git.

Example structure:

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret

CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

Use the exact variable names required by your existing environment configuration.

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Install:

Node.js

npm

MongoDB or a MongoDB Atlas database

Cloudinary account for image uploads

Razorpay account for payment functionality

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/sharmarujula123-gif/vanta-bags-ecomm.git
cd vanta-bags-ecomm

After the repository is renamed, use the updated vanta-ecomm repository URL.

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Configure environment variables

Create .env and add the required backend configuration.

4. Start the development server

npm run dev

The API will run on the configured port.

5. Verify the API

The backend exposes:

GET /
GET /api/health

A successful health response confirms that the server is running.

🧪 Testing

The backend uses Vitest and Supertest for automated testing.

Run the project's configured test command:

npm test

If a watch-mode script is configured:

npm run test:watch

🛡️ Security Practices

The backend includes several defensive layers:

Helmet security middleware

Configurable CORS policy

API rate limiting

JWT authentication

Admin authorization middleware

Request validation

Password hashing

Restricted upload handling

Request body size limits

Centralized error handling

Secrets and third-party credentials should always be supplied through environment variables.

☁️ External Services

Cloudinary

Cloudinary is used for product media and image storage, keeping large image assets outside the application server.

Razorpay

Razorpay is integrated for online payment processing. The backend also provides webhook handling and verifies payment-related requests.

📊 Backend Responsibilities

The backend acts as the application's central business layer between the frontend and external services.

It handles:

Authentication

Authorization

Product data

Category data

Cart state

Customer addresses

Orders

Reviews

Payment workflows

Image uploads

Administrative operations

Validation

Security middleware

Error handling

🔄 Frontend Integration

The backend is designed to work with the Vanta Ecomm React frontend.

Configure the production frontend origin in CORS

Use a secure JWT secret

Configure MongoDB Atlas or another production MongoDB instance

Configure Cloudinary credentials

Configure Razorpay production credentials

Verify webhook configuration

Test authentication and admin authorization

Test product and order flows

Run the automated test suite

Confirm that secrets are not committed to Git
